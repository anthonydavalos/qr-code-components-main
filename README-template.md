## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I'm becoming more familiar with Html and CSS every time I write new projects.

Code snippets, see below:

```html
<div class="container">
  <div class="card">
    <div class="card-img"></div>
    <div class="card-content">
      <h1>
        Improve your front-end skills by building projects
      </h1>
      <p>
        Scan this QR code to visit Frontend Mentor and take your coding skills to the next level
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```
```css
.container{
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  height: 100vh;
  min-height: 812px;
}
```
### Continued development

HTML and CSS, I am also interested in Javascript and React.
